Shelves are decorative storage blocks composed of two rows, each row can be placed separately. 
They come in all different wood types available in your game.

## Crafting

<table class="crafting-grid">
<thead>
    <th>Crafting Table</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Wooden Slab</td>
        <td>Wooden Slab</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

May also be crafted with wooden planks in a [sawmill](sawmill.md).

## Usage

### Placement

Shelves must be placed on walls.
Each row is placed separately like slabs.

Shelves can be placed in water.

### Interaction

Each row can store 4 different stacks of items.

Right-clicking an item onto the shelf will place one of it into the shelf at the targeted slot.
Right-clicking with an item onto the same kind of item on the shelf will attempt to store the remaining amount in hand into the shelf.   
Right-clicking with an empty hand on the shelf will open the shelf's GUI.  
Left-clicking, in survival, with an empty hand on an item placed on the shelf will remove it from the shelf.

## Technical Notes

The items in a shelf can have custom models using [render rules](technical/render_rules.md).
