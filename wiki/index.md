## Frequently Asked Question

### Can I use this in a modpack?

Yes, feel free.

### Why is this mod only working on [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org)?

First, this mod is a *comfort* mod, this means I will only use a toolchain that I feel comfortable with.

Second, this mod literally cannot work on Fabric, even if I wanted to.  
> *Wait, what do you mean it cannot work?*  

You heard me right; it cannot work on Fabric after the 1.18.2 changes. 
Fabric did not fix some stuff to account earlier registration. 
It ended up breaking this mod, and I had to patch up a lot of Fabric manually to make it work, but Quilt fixed those issues.

Third, Quilt provides nicer APIs for what this mod is trying to achieve.

And finally, I have personal issues with Fabric.

### Why is this mod not available on Forge?

Simple, I usually do not do multi-loader mods. And this mod is a *comfort* mod, making this even more unlikely.

Oh and, this mod also literally cannot be ported 1:1 to Forge due to its restrictions.

### Can I port this mod to another mod loader?

While the license isn't against it, I will voice hostility towards ports.

I spent so much time on this mod, I would really hate seeing my name or assets used on a half-baked port.
If you don't like me calling ports of this "half-baked",
it's mostly because to even port this correctly to some loader it would require
directly patching those loaders, which I doubt most porters will take time to do.

**The only case I would be favorable into ports is if Quilt ends up dying, and I am unreachable.**

### Can I port this mod to other Minecraft versions?

If it's porting to newer Minecraft versions, I guess feel free?
However, I'll ask you to write a pull-request back.
It would help reduce my own porting work and having a second pair of eyes is always better to catch mistakes.

If it's porting to earlier Minecraft versions, eeeehhhhh?
If it's targeting anything pre-1.13, I would be scared for you.
If it's targeting anything between 1.14 and 1.18, I guess you can try?
There are even earlier versions of this mod on GitHub targeting 1.18 and 1.17.
Although, for those I would kindly ask you to not claim it's official.
